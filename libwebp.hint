ldesc: "WebP is a new image format that provides lossy compression for 
photographic images. A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a 
container based on RIFF. The standalone libwebp library serves as a 
reference implementation for the WebP specification. Webmasters and web 
developers can use the WebP image format to create smaller and better 
looking images that can help make the web faster."
