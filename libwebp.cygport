DESCRPITION="WebP is a new image format that provides lossy compression for
photographic images. A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container
based on RIFF. The standalone libwebp library serves as a reference
implementation for the WebP specification. Webmasters and web developers can
use the WebP image format to create smaller and better looking images that can
help make the web faster."
